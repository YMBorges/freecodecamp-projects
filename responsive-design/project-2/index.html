            King came from a comfortable middle-class family steeped in the
            tradition of the Southern Black ministry: both his father and
            maternal grandfather were Baptist preachers. His parents were
            college-educated, and King’s father had succeeded his father-in-law
            as pastor of the prestigious Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. The
            family lived on Auburn Avenue, otherwise known as “Sweet Auburn,”
            the bustling “Black Wall Street,” home to some of the country’s
            largest and most prosperous Black businesses and Black churches in
            the years before the civil rights movement. Young Martin received a
            solid education and grew up in a loving extended family.

            Martin Luther King Sr. was an African-American Baptist pastor,
            missionary, and an early figure in the civil rights movement. He was
            the father and namesake of the civil rights leader Martin Luther
            King Jr. He was the senior pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist
            Church from 1931 to 1975.

              King graduates from Morehouse College in 1948 with a bachelor’s
              degree in sociology. He spends the next three years at Crozer
              Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania. It is here that he
              first learns about Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy of nonviolence.
              Renowned for his public speaking skills, King is elected president
              of Crozer’s student body, which is composed almost entirely of
              white students. He is the valedictorian of his class in 1951. King
              then attends graduate school at Boston University. In Boston, King
              meets Coretta Scott. They are married in 1953. The following year
              King becomes pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery,
              Alabama. He receives a Ph.D. in theology from Boston University in
              1955.

          <div class="card-description">
            In December 1955 King is chosen to head the Montgomery Improvement
            Association, formed by the Black community to lead a boycott of the
            segregated city buses. The boycott comes about after a Black woman
            named Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white man and
            was arrested. In response, King leads the Montgomery bus boycott.
            Late in 1956 the U.S. Supreme Court rules that segregation on buses
            is unconstitutional.

            The beginning of the civil rights movement

          <div class="card-description">
            In 1960 King and his family moved to his native city of Atlanta,
            where he became co-pastor with his father of the Ebenezer Baptist
            Church. At this post he devoted most of his time to the SCLC and the
            civil rights movement, declaring that the “psychological moment has
            come when a concentrated drive against injustice can bring great,
            tangible gains.” His thesis was soon tested as he agreed to support
            the sit-in demonstrations undertaken by local Black college
            students. In late October he was arrested with 33 young people
            protesting segregation at the lunch counter in an Atlanta department
            store. Charges were dropped, but King was sentenced to Reidsville
            State Prison Farm on the pretext that he had violated his probation
            on a minor traffic offense committed several months earlier. The
            case assumed national proportions, with widespread concern over his
            safety, outrage at Georgia’s flouting of legal forms, and the
            failure of Pres. Dwight D. Eisenhower to intervene. King was
            released only upon the intercession of Democratic presidential
            candidate John F. Kennedy—an action so widely publicized that it was
            felt to have contributed substantially to Kennedy’s slender election
            victory eight days later.

            King writes what comes to be known as the “Letter from Birmingham
            Jail.” That spring King had participated in a campaign in
            Birmingham, Alabama, to end segregation at lunch counters and in
            hiring practices. Police had turned dogs and fire hoses on the
            protesters, and King had been arrested along with a large number of
            his supporters. In the Birmingham jail, King writes an open letter
            to his fellow clergymen explaining his philosophy of nonviolence and
            why he would continue to protest.

          <div class="card-description">
            The rising tide of civil rights agitation produced, as King had
            hoped, a strong effect on national opinion and resulted in the
            passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, authorizing the federal
            government to enforce desegregation of public accommodations and
            outlawing discrimination in publicly owned facilities, as well as in
            employment. That eventful year was climaxed by the award to King of
            the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo in December. “I accept this award
            today with an abiding faith in America and an audacious faith in the
            future of mankind,” said King in his acceptance speech. “I refuse to
            accept the idea that the ‘isness’ of man’s present nature makes him
            morally incapable of reaching up for the eternal ‘oughtness’ that
            forever confronts him.”

              The historic Selma March, also called the Selma to Montgomery
              March, takes place. It is a political march from Selma, Alabama,
              to the state’s capital, Montgomery. King leads the march as part
              of an effort to register Black voters in the state. Demonstrators
              had twice attempted the march in the preceding weeks. On Sunday,
              March 7 (known as “Bloody Sunday”), they had been violently turned
              back by local police officers. Two weeks after Bloody Sunday as
              many as 25,000 people participate in the roughly 50-mile
              (80-kilometer) march over five days. The Selma March and the
              events surrounding it become a symbol of the civil rights
              movement. The march leads directly to the passage of the Voting
              Rights Act of 1965.
