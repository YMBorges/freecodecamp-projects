      <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</h3>
      <div id="tribute-info" class="timeline">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1929</strong> - Born in Atlanta, Georgia</li>

          <li>
            <strong>1948-55</strong> - King graduates from Morehouse College in
            1948 with a bachelor’s degree in sociology. He spends the next three
            years at Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania. It is
            here that he first learns about Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy of
            nonviolence. Renowned for his public speaking skills, King is
            elected president of Crozer’s student body, which is composed almost
            entirely of white students. He is the valedictorian of his class in
            1951. King then attends graduate school at Boston University. In
            Boston, King meets Coretta Scott. They are married in 1953. The
            following year King becomes pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church
            in Montgomery, Alabama. He receives a Ph.D. in theology from Boston
            University in 1955.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1955-56</strong> - In December 1955 King is chosen to head
            the Montgomery Improvement Association, formed by the Black
            community to lead a boycott of the segregated city buses. The
            boycott comes about after a Black woman named Rosa Parks refused to
            give up her bus seat to a white man and was arrested. In response,
            King leads the Montgomery bus boycott. Late in 1956 the U.S. Supreme
            Court rules that segregation on buses is
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1957</strong> - King and other activists, notably Bayard
            Rustin, establish a group later known as the Southern Christian
            Leadership Conference (SCLC). It is formed to help local
            organizations carry out civil rights activities in the South.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1959</strong> - A visit to India gives King a long-awaited
            opportunity to study Gandhi’s techniques of nonviolent protest.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1960</strong> - King and his family move to his native city
            of Atlanta, where he becomes co-pastor, with his father, of the
            Ebenezer Baptist Church. At this post King devotes most of his time
            to the SCLC and the civil rights movement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>April 16, 1963</strong> - King writes what comes to be known
            as the “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” That spring King had
            participated in a campaign in Birmingham, Alabama, to end
            segregation at lunch counters and in hiring practices. Police had
            turned dogs and fire hoses on the protesters, and King had been
            arrested along with a large number of his supporters. In the
            Birmingham jail, King writes an open letter to his fellow clergymen
            explaining his philosophy of nonviolence and why he would continue
            to protest.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>August 28, 1963</strong> - The historic March on Washington
            takes place. The march is organized by King and other civil rights
            leaders. More than 200,000 people participate in the demonstration.
            Near the Lincoln Memorial, in Washington, D.C., King delivers his
            famous “I Have a Dream” speech. The march influences the subsequent
            passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1964</strong> - King is announced as the winner of the Nobel
            Prize for Peace.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>March 21-25, 1965</strong> - The historic Selma March, also
            called the Selma to Montgomery March, takes place. It is a political
            march from Selma, Alabama, to the state’s capital, Montgomery. King
            leads the march as part of an effort to register Black voters in the
            state. Demonstrators had twice attempted the march in the preceding
            weeks. On Sunday, March 7 (known as “Bloody Sunday”), they had been
            violently turned back by local police officers. Two weeks after
            Bloody Sunday as many as 25,000 people participate in the roughly
            50-mile (80-kilometer) march over five days. The Selma March and the
            events surrounding it become a symbol of the civil rights movement.
            The march leads directly to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of
            1965.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1966</strong> - King initiates a drive against racial
            discrimination in Chicago.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>April 4, 1968</strong> - King is shot and killed while in
            Memphis, Tennessee, to support a strike by sanitation workers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1983</strong> - The U.S. Congress establishes Martin Luther
            King, Jr., Day, in his honor, a national holiday to be celebrated
            annually on the third Monday in January.
